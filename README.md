**security issues:**  Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability, known as CIA;  Conﬁdentiality makes sure that only the authorized user is able to read the message. Integrity makes sure that the sent message is received at the destination without any change, and availability means that each service or data is available to the user when it is needed.

全面介绍了Blockchain, 可借鉴

1） Consistency of The Ledger across Institutions. In the processes of reconciliation, clearing, and liquidation between ﬁnancial institutions, due to the architecture and business processes vary from diﬀerent ﬁnancial institutions and the involvement of manual processes, it not only leads to high transaction fees generated from the client and the backgroundbusiness side of ﬁnancial institutions, but also is prone to errors and inconsistencies between ledgers hold by diﬀerent ﬁnance institutes.

2） Integrity of Transactions. When using online transactions for investment and asset management,equity,bonds,notes,incomevouchers,warehousereceipts, andotherassets aremanaged by diﬀerent intermediaries. It not only increases the transaction costs, but also brings the risk of deliberately falsifying or forging the certiﬁcates. Thus, the system must guarantee integrity of transactions and prevent transactions from being tampered with.

3） Availability of System and Data. The users of online system should be able to access the data of transactions at any time, in anywhere. The availability here refers to both system level and transaction level. At the system level, the system should run reliably even in the event of a network attack. At the transaction level, the data of transactions can be accessed by authorized users without being unattainable, inconsistent, or corrupted.

4） Prevention of Double-Spending. An important challenge in trading digital currency in a decentralizednetwork ishowtoprevent double-spending,namelyspending acoinmorethanonce. In the centralized environment, a trusted central third party is responsible for verifying whether a digital currency has been double-spent or not. For transactions performed in a decentralized network environment, we need robust security mechanisms and countermeasures to prevent doublespending.

5） Confidentiality of Transactions. In most of the ﬁnancial online transactions, users wish to have the minimal disclosure of their transactions and account information in an online trading system. The minimal disclosure includes (1) users’ transaction information cannot be accessed by any unauthorized user; (2) the system administrator or the participant of the network cannot disclose any user’s information to others without his or her permission; (3) all user data should be stored and accessed consistently and securely even under unexpected failures or malicious cyberattacks. Such conﬁdentiality is desirable in many non-ﬁnancial scenarios.

6） Anonymity of Users’ Identity. The diﬃculty of eﬃcient and secure sharing of user data among various ﬁnancial institutions may result in a high cost of repeated user authentication. It also indirectly brings the disclosure risk of users’ identity by some intermediaries. In addition, one or both parties to the transaction may be reluctant to let the other party know their real identity in some cases.

7） Unlinkability of Transactions. Diﬀerent from identity anonymity (not revealing real identity), users should require that the transactions related to themselves cannot be linked. Because once allthe transactions relevant to a user canbe linked, it is easy to infer other information about the user, such as the account balance, the type and frequency of her transactions. Using such statistical data about transactions and accounts in conjunction with some background knowledge about a user, curious or adversarial parties may guess (infer) the true identity of the user with high conﬁdence.
